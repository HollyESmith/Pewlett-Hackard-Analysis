# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Analysis Overview

### Purpose of Analysis

Pewlitt-Hackard (PH) employs several thousand people. Baby boomers are expected to begin retiring soon and PH is making future plans to replace those retirees. Management wants to develop a mentorship program where a retiring employee, instead of retiring completely, transitions into a part-time role mentoring new hires. My assignment is to: 1) determine the number of retiring employees per title; and 2) identify the employees who are eligible to participate in the mentorship program.

## Results

- An Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) was created to visualize pre-existing PH tables and helped identify the tables’ relationships to each other. This flowchart served as the starting point in developing new tables to aid in this analysis:

- Next, the following table was created to identify which employees are expected to retire in the near future:

- Then, a table showing the aggregate number of employees retiring by job title was generated:

- Finally, a table to show which employees would be eligible for the Mentorship Program was developed:

## Summary

The total number of employees expected to retire is a whopping 90,398. However, there are enough qualified retirement-ready employees to mentor the next generation, given that 2/3 of retirees hold “Senior” titles.

Thoughts on additional analyses that may provide insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami":

1.	Why are only 2 managers slated to retire? How many managers are employed at PH and how many years of experience do those managers have? I think it would be beneficial to analyze the experience level of those employees to assess future retirement waves of managers.

2.	How many total employees are _not_ aging out with the baby boomers – employees who are expected to remain with PH after the “silver tsunami” has subsided? It would be beneficial to analyze these employee positions to estimate future staffing needs due to retirement. An analysis of current job descriptions would also be beneficial to determine which positions are redundant and could be eliminated.
